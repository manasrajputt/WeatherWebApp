Weather App 🌥️🔥🌈☃️:

➡️This is a weather web app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide up-to-date weather information for any city in the world.

➡️One of the standout features of this app is its beautiful UI, which changes its gradient background based on the current weather conditions of the searched city. This creates a unique and visually stunning way to view the weather, and makes the app stand out from other weather apps.

➡️The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. It also includes error handling to ensure that users receive accurate and reliable weather information.

➡️This project was created as a personal project to showcase my skills in front-end web development. I had a lot of fun working on it, and I'm excited to share it with others.

✅Installation and Usage:

To use this app, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. You will need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap in order to use the app.
